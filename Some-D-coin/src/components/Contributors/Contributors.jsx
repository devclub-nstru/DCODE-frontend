      <h1 className="guide-title">Contributor's Guide for DCODE</h1>
      <p className="intro-text">Welcome to DCODE, the open-source collaboration event organised by the Dev Club! We‚Äôre excited to have you join us in contributing to meaningful projects. This guide will help ensure a smooth and productive experience for all participants.</p>

      <h2 className="section-title">About DCODE</h2>
      <p className="section-text">DCODE is a unique event where developers work together to improve open-source projects. Instead of building from scratch, participants pick issues from our maintained repositories and solve them to enhance existing codebases.</p>

      <h2 className="section-title">What Are D-Coins?</h2>
      <p className="section-text">D-Coins are our event‚Äôs digital currency. You use them to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù issues, commit to solving them, and earn more by successfully contributing. They also count toward the leaderboard and can be transferred between participants.</p>

      <h2 className="section-title">Issue Availability</h2>
      <p className="section-text">At the start of the event, there will be a set of predefined issues available in the shop. More issues may be added as the event progresses based on participant petitions and discoveries.</p>

      <h2 className="section-title">How to Work on Issues</h2>
      <p className="section-text">Participants can only work on issues they have ‚Äúbought‚Äù with D-Coins. This ensures that each participant has a fair chance to contribute while helping others with issues they are interested in solving.</p>

      <h2 className="section-title">How to Contribute</h2>
      <p className="section-text">Follow these steps to contribute to DCODE:</p>

      </ul>

      <h3 className="step-title">2. Choose an Issue</h3>
      <p className="step-description">Browse through our open issues in the repositories. Use your D-Coins to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù an issue, meaning you commit to solving it. If you discover a new issue, you can petition to add it to the shop. Be respectful‚Äîissues are first come, first serve.</p>

      <h3 className="step-title">3. Fork and Clone</h3>
      <p className="step-description">Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine using the following command:</p>
      <pre className="code-snippet">git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git</pre>

      <h3 className="step-title">4. Create a Branch</h3>
      <p className="step-description">After cloning, create a new branch for your issue:</p>
      <pre className="code-snippet">git checkout -b issue-name</pre>

      <h3 className="step-title">5. Commit and Push</h3>
      <p className="step-description">Once you've made your changes, commit and push them to the repository:</p>
      <pre className="code-snippet">git commit -m "Fix: [Short Description of Fix]"</pre>
      <pre className="code-snippet">git push origin issue-name</pre>

      <h3 className="step-title">6. Submit a Pull Request (PR)</h3>
      <p className="step-description">When you're ready to submit your changes, create a pull request. In your PR description:</p>
      <ul className="pr-tips">
        <li>Clearly describe the changes you've made.</li>
        <li>Reference the issue number you're solving.</li>
        <li>Request a review from a maintainer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="section-title">Collaboration Guidelines</h2>
      <p className="section-text">DCODE is about teamwork and the open-source spirit. To maintain a positive environment:</p>
      <ul className="guidelines-list">
        <li><strong>No Issue Hoarding:</strong> You can only work on one issue at a time.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect Others‚Äô Work:</strong> If an issue is assigned to someone, let them work on it.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Constructive:</strong> Give helpful feedback in PR reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>Help First-Timers:</strong> Encourage and guide newcomers.</li>

        <li>If approved, the issue will be listed for others to ‚Äúbuy.‚Äù</li>
        <li>If you want to work on it yourself, you get priority.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="section-title">Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer</h2>
      <p className="section-text">We want your help. No really, we do.</p>
      <p className="section-text">There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help with this project.</p>
      <p className="section-text">I assure you, that's not the case. This document contains some contribution guidelines and best practices, but if you don't get it right the first time, we'll try to help you fix it.</p>
      <p className="section-text">The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, we hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.</p>
      <p className="section-text">And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)</p>
      <p className="section-text">If you have questions or want to chat, feel free to reach out in our Dev Club Discord <a href="https://discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> or GitHub issues.</p>
